# Welcome

Hi there! Welcome to the github repository for my personal website. This is where I'll keep a record my personal history, provide interesting stories about myself, and maintain a few blogs that I think are worthwhile.

## About the repo

This website is built using NextJS/Mantine Components/MUI5/MDX and is a pretty good example for a lot of useful little things if you're looking to create a static website with nextJS and publish it using a custom domain name via github actions.

You can find basic examples of things like:

    - React Image Gallery
    - Swipwer for React
    - Technical blog posts on varoius topics
    - Blog posts about a .NET library I created called Sailfish
    - configuration for tailwindcss and mantine
    - over time, much more

You are welcome to explore this repository as you'd like. If you copy anything directly, just give me a mention somehwere with a link back.

Cheers!
