### Find your entrance into the garden

When I landed my first job at a tech company, there happened to be a company dinner party at the end of the first week. During this party, one of the other employees on my team came up to me and said,

    <Quote>Getting through the front door is really difficult. But man, once you're in, you're IN</Quote>

As someone coming into the tech industry from a background in biology - getting in was difficult. I was almost entirely self taught in the ways of programming, had no real substative formal education, and made the brazen decision to try and pry my way in without so much as a bootcamp course. This was risky. But I wasn't stupid about it.

I considered that there were probably a million people out there better qualified than me. There were definitely people with more experience than me. So what on earth made me think that I might be able to land the job over someone else?

### When you lack what they are asking for, leverage what you already have

To use a metaphore - Entering in to your new field is like entering into a beautiful garden surrounded by a tall stone wall. The mistakes that most people make when trying to enter the garden is that they tend to try to jump over the wall (take shortcuts) or break through the stone wall directly. You see - the folks that enter through the front gate are those that either have started early in highschool in the field and progressed through university or some specialized study course. Or they have family that have groomed them. If you are switching fields later in life - then you are not entering through the front gate - so you'd better be careful not to hit the garden wall head on. And it should go without saying that if you leap over the wall - everyone is going to see you do it. Its really obvious when someone has taken shortcuts.

I realized this and took a look at my options. I realized I wasn't entering through the front gate, and I wouldn't be able break through the wall - so my only option was to find another entrance into the garden.

Getting a job at a tech company as a software engineer wasn't going to be possible for me - despite having written software during my PhD. But that experience, mixed with my analytical skills, the skills I'd developed working with very large datasets, and the machine learning tools I'd leveraged to accomplish my analyses and ultimately finish my PhD - could be leveraged to fill a different role - Data Scientist.

Data Science was my back door entrance to the Tech Company garden.

Ultimately, my journey was: Biologist -> Bioinformatician -> Data Scientist -> Software Engineer

So find your entrance to the garden. If you can't make it through the front door - don't try and hop the wall. Instead, leverage your background and use it to find that back entrance.
