## A quick background on Paul's career

I didn't always want to be a software engineer. In fact, there was a time when I deliberately wanted to NOT be a software engineer, or have anything to do with computers. In the beginning, I wanted to be a drummer.

When I was a teenager, I was lazer focussed on being a performance artist. I was obsessed with this idea of being in a band, behind a drumset, laying down the beat for some kick ass band. I had pretty clear dreams - I was to achieve becoming the drummer for a Steely Dan concert or studio session (an absurd goal - this was a band that peaked in the 70s...).

After I finished high school - I had to make a difficult decision:

<HPos position="center">Continue on the path of music - or - change directions.</HPos>

There came a point where there was no more uncertainty about this, and I had to do the difficult thing of figuring out what else to do. The only problem was - I hadn't actually spent any time prior to this investing into developing any other skills.

But hey! This was America in 2004! You can go to University with no idea what you want to do and spend $80,000 figuring that out! Getting into University isn't necessarily guaranteed (especially if your high school GPA is mediocre), but usually where there is a will (to irresponsibly indebt yourself) - there is a way. And I thus made the somewhat arbitrary decision to pursue dentistry.

Fast foward a decade, and I would find myself begining my journey into software engineering - when I started writing analytical software for my PhD.

A career in academia was, however not to be - so I leveraged my skillset to obtain a position as a Data Scientist at a major software company called Zendesk. While here, I realized something rather important - data science (though hot at the time) would flash brightly... and then fizzle out. A fad position that I happened to be perfectly timed for (thank goodness) I would say. And I realized that if I wanted any long term security in the tech industry, I would have to really up my engineering game.

Thats when I decided to move on to Octopus Deploy - where I currently preside as a software engineer.
