2021 was a productive year for Palavyr. We completed development on all basic product features and we launched our basic services! And to put the icing on the proverbial cake, we secured our first trial customer after a mere 4 months!

Winning!

But who is this mystery customer you ask? Well, without further ado, I would like to introduce JoJo Roof Improvement!

JoJo Roof Improvement is a roof restoration business owned and operated by sole trader Johann Gigho, operating out of Melbourne, Australia.

It turns out, a roof is a lot more than just a cover for the boxes we all live in. There are a lot of types of roofs, and there are a lot of different parts to these roofs. There is even an entire technical vocabulary used to describe all these parts!

JoJo Roof Improvement provides a range of services that include cleaning, repair, and replacement of all types of roofs. <i>And the quality they provide is second to none</i>. If you'd like to learn more about JoJo Roof Improvement, please visit their website at <a>https://www.jojoroof.com.au</a>.

Like with many small businesses operated by an individual, a key problem for JoJo Roof Improvement is lead generation and capture. In other words, finding customers and helping customers find him. For tradesmen, the problem is even more difficult since people will often shop around and try to get competitive bids on the jobs they are hiring out for.

Let’s use an example to illustrate.

A homeowner needs their gutters cleaned, so the homeowner finds three cleaners and asks each of them to provide a fee quote detailing how much their services will cost. The homeowner then evaluates the three cleaners based on their reputation and how much they intend to charge to complete the cleaning job.

In this scenario, the homeowner may or may not receive a response from one or all of the cleaners. If a tradesman is out working their trade, perhaps they don't have the time, or even the energy (after a long day of hard work) to get back to you. You may have experienced this yourself, but it is all too common for small businesses to simply never reply to customer enquiries. In fact, this scenario was one of the motivating factors behind Palavyr.

### Your online presence is essential

These days, small businesses need to establish an online presence to improve their chances of being found in the first place. When you put your business online, you need to communicate online. Unfortunately for most companies, this means simply providing a phone number or email contact form on the web page. . . which leaves them in the same position they started in - having to manage phone calls and emails.

To make matters worse, most time is spent answering the same questions, collecting the same details, and providing the same type of quote, albeit with slight differences depending on the details of the job.

When JoJo Roof Improvement discovered Palavyr, it was immediately clear that Palavyr could help deliver personalized service details and quotes through an engaging chat experience. Palavyr is able to take details from customers, and then provide a quote based on the details provided.

    “Personally, I love the idea of Palavyr. I think many websites would love to have it. The only concern for me is
    that I am not gonna be the only one who does have it!“ - Johann Ghigo
</Quote>

JoJo Roof Improvement saw that, with a well designed website and sufficient traffic, they could automate the process of delivering service quotes to customers, along with any other bits of information their potential customers might need to make an informed decision about whether or not to choose their services. In their experience, customers will often simply choose the first option that returns to them the information they need to make the decision. (And if your prices are competitive… well that helps a lot too). People these days don’t want a lot of hassle when hiring for jobs that involve their home.

Now that their chat bot is fully configured, you can visit www.jojoroof.com.au and see it in action. And if you own a house in the Melbourne, Australia greater metropolitan area - you can easily get yourself a service fee quote for roof restoration services.

## The JoJo Roof Improvement custom chat widget and launcher

JoJo Roof improvement has customized their chat widget to suit their branding themes. The JoJo-Palavyr chat widget provides a very attractive and engaging chat experience while remaining humble and simple in its design.

The launch button (the button you click to open the widget) has even been customized with their logo. We’ll have a future post with details on how to use this new feature!
