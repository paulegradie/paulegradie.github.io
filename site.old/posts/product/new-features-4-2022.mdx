Hey there!

Palavyr has just launched two new incredible features! Woo!

## The Restart-the-chat button

Your customers love your chat bot. They engage with it, they use it, and they get the information they are after. Sometimes, though, someone just might want to restart the chat before they finish.

If your users have been good enough to provide their name and contact details, then we shouldn't pester them with having to reenter those details if they want to select a different intent. We should make that easy for them to do.

The Restart-the-chat button is a simple way to get your users back to the beginning of the chat. When the button is enabled, they are able to reset back to intent selection. In the process, a new chat is started, but the user's name and contact details are retained.

## The Chat Speed button

We really don't want to waste anyone's time. Time is precious. One of the motivations behind the design of the Palavyr platform is to help users get the information they want in a reasonable amount of time. To empower your customers, we give users control over the speed of the chat. If they want to skip the realism of the delay between messages, they can toggle the speed switch to hasten things along.
