                    I have spent the last few years working for Octopus Deploy where I have helped migrate webserver
                    frameworks, fix a ton of bugs, added features, and, more recently, developed the organizations
                    understanding of the CI/CD pipeline, increase its reliablity by over 100%, and decrease the build
                    chain runtime from nearly two hours down to currently about half an hour.

                    I have chronologically ordered stories available on my personal blog. It may suffice here simply to
                    say that I am many things: a Software engineer, a Scientist, a Problem Solver, a Team Player, and a
                    New Father who enjoys pair programming, learning, and building things well.

                    My background intersects with Software Engineering, Biology, Bioinformatics, Machine Learning
                    (including Deep Learning), and Natural Language Processing.
