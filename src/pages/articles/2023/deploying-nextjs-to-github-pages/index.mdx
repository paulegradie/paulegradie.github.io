I don't typically write tutorials. More often then not, for anything I might share,
there are already about a million tutorials out there. Instead, I prefer to share
deeper insights into problems that can only be expressed through stories.

In setting up this iteration of my personal website, I came across a simple error so infuriating that I am compelled to share it here.

# Take care when deploying NextJS static sites with nextMDX

Okay - I'll get right to the point. When settings up this website, I decided to use github actions to deploy the static site. Github provides a default standard action template for this:

```yml
# Sample workflow for building and deploying a Next.js site to GitHub Pages
#
# To get started with Next.js see: https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started
#
name: Deploy Next.js site to Pages

on:
  # Runs on pushes targeting the default branch
  push:
    branches: ['main']

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

# Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued.
# However, do NOT cancel in-progress runs as we want to allow these production deployments to complete.
concurrency:
  group: 'pages'
  cancel-in-progress: false

jobs:
  # Build job
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Detect package manager
        id: detect-package-manager
        run: |
          if [ -f "${{ github.workspace }}/yarn.lock" ]; then
            echo "manager=yarn" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
            echo "command=install" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
            echo "runner=yarn" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
            exit 0
          elif [ -f "${{ github.workspace }}/package.json" ]; then
            echo "manager=npm" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
            echo "command=ci" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
            echo "runner=npx --no-install" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
            exit 0
          else
            echo "Unable to determine package manager"
            exit 1
          fi
      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3

        with:
          # Automatically inject basePath in your Next.js configuration file and disable

          #
          # You may remove this line if you want to manage the configuration yourself.
          static_site_generator: next
      - name: Restore cache

        with:
          path: |

          # Generate a new cache whenever packages or source files change.
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-nextjs-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json', '**/yarn.lock') }}-${{ hashFiles('**.[jt]s', '**.[jt]sx') }}
          # If source files changed but packages didn't, rebuild from a prior cache.

      - name: Build with Next.js
        run: ${{ steps.detect-package-manager.outputs.runner }} next build
      - name: Static HTML export with Next.js
        run: ${{ steps.detect-package-manager.outputs.runner }} next export
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v1
        with:
          path: ./out

  # Deployment job
  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v2
```

I'm not going to go through this action line by line or anything, but I do want to call out one particular section:

```yml
- name: Setup Pages
  uses: actions/configure-pages@v3
  with:
    # Automatically inject basePath in your Next.js configuration file and disable
    # server side image optimization (https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image#unoptimized).
    #
    # You may remove this line if you want to manage the configuration yourself.
    static_site_generator: next
```

This section is a bit nefarious - if you don't know what its doing, or what the specific requirements of your application are.

This website uses `nextMDX`. That requires some specific next.config.js configuration to get working correctly.

What this step `Setup Pages` above does is - when used - is it will overwrite your next.config.js configuration. It tries to inject / override the image optimization settings (which is not available atm for nextJS app exported as static sites) - but instead will blow away all of your custom configuration! Here are the logs from the github action:

```text
Using default blank configuration
Injecting property=basePath and value= in:
// Default Pages configuration for Next
const nextConfig = {}
module.exports = nextConfig

Found configuration object in indirect module export
Injection successful, new configuration:
// Default Pages configuration for Next
const nextConfig = {basePath: ""}
module.exports = nextConfig

Injecting property=experimental.images.unoptimized and value=true in:
// Default Pages configuration for Next
const nextConfig = {basePath: ""}
module.exports = nextConfig

Found configuration object in indirect module export
Injection successful, new configuration:
// Default Pages configuration for Next
const nextConfig = {experimental: {images: {unoptimized: true}},basePath: ""}
module.exports = nextConfig

Injecting property=images.unoptimized and value=true in:
// Default Pages configuration for Next
const nextConfig = {experimental: {images: {unoptimized: true}},basePath: ""}
module.exports = nextConfig

Found configuration object in indirect module export
Injection successful, new configuration:
// Default Pages configuration for Next
const nextConfig = {images: {unoptimized: true},experimental: {images: {unoptimized: true}},basePath: ""}
module.exports = nextConfig
```

So the error result from this overwrite manifested as a webpack error, which was very confusing:

```text
info  - Linting and checking validity of types...
info  - Creating an optimized production build...
Failed to compile.

./src/pages/articles/advice-for-changing-fields.mdx

Error: Process completed with exit code 1.
```

## The Solution

To fix this - when using nextMDX - you need manage your `next.config.js` configuration yourself. So basicaly -- delete this step.

Of course, the configuration I use in this site is:

```js
import nextMDX from '@next/mdx'
import remarkGfm from 'remark-gfm'
import rehypePrism from '@mapbox/rehype-prism'

const isProd = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
let nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  pageExtensions: ['js', 'jsx', 'md', 'mdx'],
}

if (isProd) {
  nextConfig = {
    ...nextConfig,
    images: {
      unoptimized: true,
    }
  }
}

const withMDX = nextMDX({
  extension: /\.mdx?$/,
  options: {
    providerImportSource: "@mdx-js/react",
    remarkPlugins: [remarkGfm],
    rehypePlugins: [rehypePrism],
  },
})

export default withMDX(nextConfig)
```

With that in place, the github action was able to build, and the site deployed.

I hope you found that helpful.
