I was once asked by a collegueue if I thought it wise to place a PhD suffix on my LinkedIn profile name. Does this sound like a strange question to you? It felt like a strange question to me at the time - my immediate thought was 'obviously yes'.

Since then, I've had some time to reflect on this question. Just because that question is obvious to me, doesn't mean its ovbious to everyone else. Some people might have legitimate unresolved reasons why they believe using their title is not a good idea. And that would be totally okay. I'll preface this entire post by saying that its completely fine to use or not use the title. I do personally use it though, so I'll share some thoughts about why that is as well as some additional reason you should consider it.

I will also add that I realize that not everyone holds a degree title - thats completely fine as well. This post is inspired by my PhD, but you can simply substitute that for any degree or title that you have.

I hold a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree. This is a prestigious academic credential that signifies one's advanced knowledge, expertise, and research skill. Holding this particular degree immediately confers some knowledge of that person's competence not only in their trained skills, but also their ability to aquire new skills. They are masters of it - they will know their own mind well enough to quickly teach themselves anthing they need to know to succeed.

Of course a PhD is't automatically going to be a quality team member - as many of us have learned the hard way - but it does generally signal that they are able to think critically and deeply on a subject sufficiently to have achieved a high level of academic achievement. In other words, knowing someone holds a PhD should tell you something about that person.

Your PhD title on LinkedIn can also help you stand out in a crowded job market. Recruiters and hiring managers often use LinkedIn to search for candidates with specific qualifications, and including your PhD in your profile can help you appear in those search results.

In many industries, having a PhD can be a significant advantage, as it demonstrates your ability to conduct rigorous research, analyze complex data, and think critically. You can position yourself as a thought leader in your field, which can help you attract new opportunities and advance your career by including your PhD title on LinkedIn and being vocal about it.

Lastly, including your PhD title on LinkedIn can help you build your professional network. People with similar academic backgrounds may be more inclined to connect with you, as they may share similar research interests or have experienced similar challenges in their academic journeys. This was true in my case - it was by the fact that I had my title already in my profile name that I was contacted in the first place. By connecting with other professionals in your field, you can expand your knowledge, share ideas, and build collaborative relationships that could lead to new opportunities.

So - in my opinion - including your PhD title on LinkedIn is a good idea for establishing your credibility, demonstrating your expertise, and building your professional network. It can also help you stand out in a crowded job market and help you position yourself as a thought leader in your field.
